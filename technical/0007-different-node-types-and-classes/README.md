## Summary

Describes the different types and classes of nodes.

## Motivation

To operate a Blockchain network it is important to know the different node types and classes and to use them correctly. There are several ways to operate a node. To get an overview of all possible ways.

## Specification

The following is an overview of the different types and classes of a node (the list is not exhaustive):

- Validator Node
- Observer Node
- non-validating peer Node
- Archive Nodes
- Light nodes
- Full nodes
- authority-nodes
- non-authority nodes


## Examples & Best Practices

We can look at the [Sovrin Steward Technical and Orgnaizatoinal Policies](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Steward-Technical-and-Organizational-Policies-V2.pdf) as an example implementation:
> A Steward Node:
> * MUST be available to run as a Validator Node or Observer Node on any of the formal ledgers that make up the Sovrin Network.



## Drawbacks


## Prior art

 Sovrin provide frameworks and technical documentation that define Node requirements.
