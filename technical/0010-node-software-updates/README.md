## Summary

Software update policy for operating a blockchain node. This applies not only to the applications but also to the operating system. 

## Motivation

To create a safe environment throughout the Blockchain network, software update guidelines are extremely important. All nodes must be updated at a certain interval to ensure safe operation. However, the actual process is quite complex as the entire network must be considered.

## Specification


## Examples & Best Practices

We can look at the [Sovrin Steward Technical and Orgnaizatoinal Policies](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Steward-Technical-and-Organizational-Policies-V2.pdf) as an example implementation:
> A Steward Node:
> * MUST run a release of the Sovrin Open Source Code as approved and designated by
    the Technical Governance Board (TGB).
> * MUST facilitate an upgrade to a new version of the Sovrin Open Source Code within
    three (3) business days of a new release that has been: a) recommended by the Sovrin
    TGB, and b) accepted by a vote of any other relevant Sovrin Governing Body (such as
    the Steward Council).


## Drawbacks


## Prior art

 Sovrin provide frameworks and technical documentation that define Node requirements.
