# eco Blockchain Governance Framework (eBGF)

## Motivation

The eco Blockchain Governance Framework (eBGF) serves as an abstract collection of questions and problems that need to be adressed, in order to operate a professional, production-grade, blockchain network. 
Hence a concrete blockchain governance which defines answers to (all) the points outlined by the eBGF can be considered a eBGF compliant blockchain governance implementation.

## Working Groups

In the initial step, the eBGF is structure along 4 seperate working (technical, legal, ecnomy & incentives, network governance) to handle these partial aspect of governance. 
Those should align their working with regards to the [Trust over IP](https://trustoverip.org/) Layer 1 (Utility Layer).
In order to keep an initial focus, the applicability of the eBGF on the blockchain technologies Ethereum and Hyperledger Indy needs to be considered.
