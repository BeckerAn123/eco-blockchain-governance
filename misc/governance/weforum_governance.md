# Consortium Governance

The Consortium Governance section is split into Business Governance and Operational Governance.

Business Governance
 - roles & responsibilities
 - purpose & governance
 - IP (intellectual property) management
 - competition and inclusion
 - liability & role management
 - strategy & economics

Operational Governance
- on/off- boarding
- dispute resolution
- change management
- data standards
- data sharing & storing

## Participant on-boarding / off-boarding
A blockchain network has to have objective criteria that determine which parties can participate.

Exit plans can be set up for leaving participants in order to guarantee a smooth transition. Transferring any assets and transactions needs to be analyzed case by case. This may also tie in with intellectual property (IP).

## Dispute resolutions and errors
Disputes are more likely to occur on off-chain usage of data and compliance to data protection policies rather than for on-chain data usage.

An internal dispute resolution body may be set up by vote. Otherwise the cases can be settled in court or by arbitration bodies.

All blockchain network participants should consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the selected dispute resolution body.

Also consider the circumstances when a participant should be required to reverse a transaction or refrain from completing a partial transaction.

## System change management
Agreeing upon system upgrades and maintanance is difficult.

Best practices in security & data sharing for blockchain networks is still in development.

Blockchain developers need to ensure that software is backwards compatible so that transactions and data are not lost after software upgrades.

A technical committee should oversee the upgrade and maintanence decisions.

Enough lead time must be given to the participants to ensure internal testing of new versions before production. Emergency updates needs to be regulated.

If the consortium is developing its own blockchain protocol or applications, members will need to consider:
 - how code is managed?
 - who has control over the official codebase?
 - who has the right to request changes?
 - who decides what changes to make?
 - how are changes propagated across the network?

## Data sharing and storing
Depending on the protocol used (public permissionless or permissioned) the type of data storage mechanism is important.

Another decision to make is what data will be broadcast to all users of the solution or shared between parties to a transaction.

Storing some data externally may be an option, otherwise data may stack up quite quickly.

Set data standard that all participants align with and which regulates the presented and shared information.

Options for storing data:
 - centralized storage (few endpoints but vulnerable)
 - storage by data owner with retrieval on demand (protects data autonomy but vulnerable)
 - decentralized storage (solves resiliency concerns but introduces addional endpoints)
